# Implementation Plan: AI Group Conversational Stimulation Platform for Dementia

## Overview

A full-stack application enabling structured, AI-moderated group conversations for people with mild-to-moderate dementia. One human participant speaks with a group of persistent AI characters and an AI moderator in real-time voice conversations.

### Patient-First Design Philosophy

**This platform is built specifically for people with dementia.** The patient experience is the #1 priority, and the interface must be so intuitive that patients can use it independently and confidently.

**Key Documents**:
- **Section 6** of this document contains comprehensive Patient UX Design standards
- **PATIENT_UX_GUIDE.md** - Detailed patient UX specifications (integrated into Section 6)
- **README_PATIENT_FLOW.md** - Quick reference for patient journey (integrated into Section 6.2)

**Two Distinct Design Systems**:
1. **Patient-Facing Interface** (Section 6): Super-intuitive, extra-large elements, warm and encouraging, voice-first
2. **Admin/Clinician Interface** (Section 7): Professional Aura Health design system with data-dense analytics

**Critical Success Criteria**:
- ✅ Patient can complete full conversation flow without help
- ✅ Patient feels confident and encouraged, not anxious
- ✅ Patient wants to use the app again
- ✅ Caregiver feels comfortable leaving patient alone with the app
